Steal all saved browser passwords within 6 seconds using an USB exploit




Hello everyone
Today im gonna teach you how to steal all saved browser passwords within 6 seconds using an USB exploit
This trick uses autorun but this exploit didnt work in some windows versions like windows 8.1 and up
so we need to click start.bat
Follow this steps:
1) download this tool
2) Move it to USB drive
3) If you want to exploit windows 8 or higher then let the files as they are showed because you need them unhide to click the start.bat file 
   If you want to exploit windows 7 or older then put it hiding in your USB drive because autorun will start automatically 
4) After that go to the folder PASSWORD
	Boom and the here we go you will find all saved browser passwords in a text file :D





Thanks is enought ..............
